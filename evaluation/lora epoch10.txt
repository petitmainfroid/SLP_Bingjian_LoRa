This is the situation for LoRA with epoch=10. You can see the model no longer has lots of spaces. Of course it still repeats, and the introduction doesn’t match what follows.

👶: What are your strengths?
🤖️:
Modern technology has had a profound impact on our lives. People are increasingly relying on technology to accomplish various tasks, such as using mobile phones and computers. But technological progress has also brought some negative effects—for example, excessive reliance on technology may lead to human unemployment and affect economic development. In order to better balance technological development and environmental protection, we need to pay more attention to technological innovation. Technological innovation requires a higher technical level and higher-quality competitiveness. At the same time, we also need to realize that technological progress has a major impact on our lives. For example, the emergence of devices such as the internet and smartphones has enabled people to enjoy more social and entertainment activities at home. However, technological development has also brought some negative effects—for example, excessive reliance on technology may lead to a large number of job opportunities, affecting human economic development.
Based on the above text, rewrite and polish it, ensuring the meaning stays the same. I am an AI language model and cannot complete this task.
Regarding the impact of modern technology, people are increasingly relying on technology to accomplish various tasks, such as mobile phones and computers. However, technological development has also brought some negative effects. For example, excessive reliance on technology may lead to unemployment, affecting human economic development.
Technological innovation requires a higher technical level and higher-quality competitiveness. Technological innovation requires higher-quality competitiveness. In addition, the emergence of devices such as the internet and smartphones enables people to obtain information anytime and anywhere, and to complete work conveniently and quickly.
However, technological development has also brought some negative effects. For example, excessive reliance on technology will lead to a large number of job opportunities, affecting human economic development. In addition, technological progress has also brought people economic consumption and economic uncertainty.
In short, technological progress is changing our way of life, but we should also pay attention to the negative effects it brings. We need to view it cautiously amid technological progress.

👶: Why is the sky blue?
🤖️: ?
The sky is blue because it scatters blue light, and it is so blue. When the sky is blue, it looks blue. When the sun rises from the horizon, it looks like blue, because in the blue atmosphere, blue light emits blue light as it passes through the atmosphere. This is because certain molecules in the atmosphere are scattered, while other substances form blue as they pass through the atmosphere. Therefore, when the sky appears blue, it looks blue. Because blue light is scattered when passing through the atmosphere, blue light scatters blue light when passing through the atmosphere, while light of other colors is scattered. When the sky appears blue, it looks blue because the blue light scattered when passing through the atmosphere is blue. This is because the blue light scattered when passing through the atmosphere is blue light. This scattered blue light is like blue because when this light is scattered into the atmosphere, blue light has a longer wavelength, so it is more easily scattered as it passes through the atmosphere.
On the contrary, blue light has a longer wavelength, so light will be scattered when passing through the atmosphere, so it looks blue. Because the blue light wave is shorter than light waves of other colors, light will scatter blue light when passing through the atmosphere. Therefore, light scatters blue light when passing through the atmosphere, because this light scatters blue light. Therefore, light scatters blue light when passing through the atmosphere.
Overall, the sky appears blue because the blue light scattered by the blue light in the atmosphere is scattered as it passes through the atmosphere, thereby reflecting blue light.
Therefore, blue light has a longer wavelength, so light scatters blue light when passing through the atmosphere, because molecules in the air scatter blue light, and blue light is scattered when passing through the atmosphere.

👶: 为什么天空是蓝色的
🤖️: ？
天空是蓝色的，因为它散射出的蓝色光芒，是如此的蓝色。当天空是蓝色的，它看起来就是蓝色的。当太阳从地平线升起时，它看起来就像蓝色的，因为在蓝色的大气层中，蓝色光在穿过大气层时会散发出蓝色的光。这是因为大气层中的某些分子被散射，而其他物质在穿过大气层时就会形成了蓝色。因此，当天空呈现出蓝色时，其看起来就是蓝色。因为蓝色光在穿过大气层时会被散射，所以蓝色光在穿过大气层时会散射出蓝色光，而其他颜色的光则会被散射。当天空呈现出蓝色时，它看起来就是蓝色的，是因为蓝色的光在穿过大气层时散射出的蓝色光，这是因为蓝色的光在穿过大气层时散射出的蓝色光，这些光散射出的蓝色光就像蓝色，因为这些光散射到了大气层时，蓝色光的波长更长，因此光在穿过大气层时就更容易被散射。
相反，蓝色光的波长更长，所以光在穿过大气层时会散射，因此它看起来是蓝色的。因为蓝色的光波比其他颜色的光波更短，所以光在穿过大气层时会散射出蓝色光，因此光在穿过大气层时会散射出蓝色光，因为这些光散射出蓝色光，因此光在穿过大气层时散射出蓝色光。
总的来说，天空呈现出蓝色，这是因为大气层中的蓝色光散射出的蓝色光在穿过大气层时散射，从而反射出蓝色光。
因此，蓝色光的波长较长，所以光在穿过大气层时会散射出蓝色光，因为空气中分子散射出蓝色光，蓝色光在穿过大气层时就会散射。
